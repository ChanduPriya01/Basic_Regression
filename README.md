# Basic_Regression
This repository deals with the basic data pre-processing, building up some regression models for an unknown data

Data Given:

dataset known.csv: a dataset containing 2000 data samples, 200 input variables and 1 target variable.
dataset unknown.csv: a dataset containing 500 data samples in similar format, but where the target values are unknown.
Objectives The 3 main objectives of the task are:

Explore the data, understand its structure and identify the key input variables that drive the target.
Train and test a model that predicts, to the best extent possible, the target value from some or all the input variables.
Generate a prediction for the unknown dataset.
